##ABOUT
Using the Google Maps API, TIPical allows users to post tips and search locations which then queries our database for nearby tips. It was made to cement our understanding of Express and server-side JavaScript development. You can see a sample app deployed [here](https://glacial-coast-82060.herokuapp.com/app/)!
